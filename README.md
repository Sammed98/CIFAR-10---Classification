# Inter-IIT-Qualifiers
Trials and studies on developing our own Classifier on CIFAR 10 Architectures

## Dataset:
The CIFAR 10 Dataset is one of the most popular benchmark datasets for  Image Classification. 
It can be found prebuilt on Keras.datasets or at [This CS Toronto Page](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

## Requirements
1. Keras
2. Matplotlib
3. Numpy
4. Scipy 

All the above can be installed via `pip install` for Python2 and `pip3 install ` for Python3 

## Final Model Accuracy:
| Model 1 | 5 |
| Model 1 + SVM  | 85.09  |
| Model 2| 84.32  |
